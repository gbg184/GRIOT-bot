Overview:
The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 board.
Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O".

Players choose a number between 1 and 9 to place their symbol on the corresponding position on the board.
The game continues until one player wins by aligning three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the game ends in a draw when all spaces are filled.
